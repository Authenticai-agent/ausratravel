## Content & Messaging Guardrails

### Always Emphasize

### Avoid Overemphasizing

⚠️ **Luxury for Luxury's Sake:** Focus on authentic experiences, not just premium pricing  
⚠️ **Exclusivity Alone:** Exclusivity matters but authenticity is primary differentiator  
⚠️ **Generic "Best" Claims:** Use specific metrics and results instead  
⚠️ **Overpromising:** Stay realistic about capacity, availability, and experiences  

### Key Messages to Reinforce

1. **"Authentic Provençal artisan experiences unavailable through standard travel channels"**
2. **"Small-group intimacy (8-10 guests) ensures genuine connections with local culture"**
3. **"Direct relationships with local artisans preserving traditional techniques"**
