# Business Metrics & Capacity Analysis

## Offer (1 Line)

**Authentic 4-day artisan experiences in Castellane, France: all-inclusive meals, accommodation, local workshops, and small-group intimacy (8–10 guests) at $700/day/person—no hidden fees.**

---

## ACV (Average Contract Value)

### Pricing Structure:
- **Double occupancy:** $700/day/person
- **Single occupancy:** $900/day/person  
- **Without accommodation:** $600/day/person
- **4-day package:** $2,800 (double) | $3,600 (single)

### Assumptions:
- Average booking size: **1.75 guests** per reservation (mix of solo travelers and couples)
- Average occupancy: **65% double, 30% single, 5% without accommodation**
- Standard trip: **4 days, 3 nights** (minimum)

### ACV Calculation:
```
Weighted Average Price Per Person = 
  (0.65 × $700) + (0.30 × $900) + (0.05 × $600) = $455 + $270 + $30 = $755/person/day

Average Guests per Booking = 1.75

ACV per Booking = $755 × 1.75 guests × 4 days = $5,285
```

**ACV = ~$5,285 per booking**

*Note: Includes occasional extra days before/after ($700-1,200/person/day) and add-ons, which may push actual ACV to $5,500-6,000.*

## LTV (Lifetime Value)

### Customer Retention & Referral Assumptions:
- **Repeat rate:** 15-20% book a second trip within 2 years
- **Referral rate:** 25-30% refer 1-2 new customers
- **Average trips per lifetime customer:** 1.2 trips
- **Average referral value:** 0.3 × $5,285 = $1,585 per customer

### LTV Calculation:
```
Base Value (1.2 trips) = $5,285 × 1.2 = $6,342
Referral Value = $1,585
Total LTV = $6,342 + $1,585 = $7,927
```

**LTV = ~$8,000 per customer** (conservative estimate)

*Note: Higher engagement customers (yoga retreats, art workshops) may have LTV of $10,000-12,000 with 2-3 trips and stronger referrals.*

## Maximum New Clients/Month Capacity

### Operational Constraints:
- **Group size:** 8–10 guests per experience
- **Trip duration:** 4 days, 3 nights (fixed)
- **Available experiences:** 9 different experience types
- **Seasonal factors:** Lavender season (June–August), shoulder seasons vary

### Capacity Scenarios:

#### **Scenario A: Single Experience (Most Limited)**
- If operating only **1 experience type** at a time:
- Groups per month: **30 days ÷ 4 days per trip = ~7.5 trips/month**
- Capacity: **7.5 trips × 9 guests = ~68 guests/month**
- **Max new clients/month: ~60-70** (accounting for overlap, travel days)

#### **Scenario B: Multiple Experiences (Parallel Operations)**
- Operating **2-3 experience types simultaneously** (different dates):
- Groups per month: **15-22 trips/month** across experiences
- Capacity: **15 trips × 9 guests = ~135 guests/month**
- **Max new clients/month: ~120-150** (with optimized scheduling)

#### **Scenario C: Peak Season (June–August)**
- Operating **all 9 experiences** with higher demand:
- Groups per month: **30-40 trips/month**
- Capacity: **35 trips × 9 guests = ~315 guests/month**
- **Max new clients/month: ~280-300** (peak capacity)

### Recommended Capacity Planning:

**Conservative (Sustainable):**
- **80-100 new clients/month**
- 10-12 trips/month
- Mix of 2-3 experience types
- Allows for quality control, personalization, and host availability

**Aggressive (With Expanded Host Network):**
- **150-200 new clients/month**
- 18-25 trips/month
- 4-5 experience types running simultaneously
- Requires additional local hosts, guides, and accommodation partners

**Maximum Theoretical:**
- **250-300 new clients/month**
- 30-35 trips/month
- Full suite of experiences + extended stays
- Requires significant infrastructure: multiple host properties, backup guides, scalable operations

## Growth Recommendations

1. **Phase 1 (Months 1-6):** Target 60-80 clients/month to establish quality and refine operations
2. **Phase 2 (Months 7-12):** Scale to 120-150 clients/month with 3-4 experience types running simultaneously
3. **Phase 3 (Year 2+):** Expand to 200+ clients/month with additional host properties and guide partnerships

**Bottleneck Factors:**
- Host accommodation availability in Castellane region
- Local artisan/guide availability and scheduling
- Seasonal demand fluctuations (summer peak, winter low)
- Airport transfer capacity (Nice Airport pickups)
- Meal service and logistics for larger groups

**Scalability Levers:**
- Partner with additional local hosts/properties
- Train backup guides for each experience type
- Extend shoulder seasons with weather-appropriate experiences
- Add mid-week and weekend trip options
- Implement tiered pricing for extended stays (5-7 days)
